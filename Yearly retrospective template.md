## 2 Reflect

-  What kind of media did you wish you consumed less of?
-  What kind of media do you wish you consumed more of?
-  What were your biggest disappointments of the year?
-  What were your top 3 wins this year?
-  Who influenced your life the most (positive or negative)?
-  In what areas do you need to forgive yourself?
-  Who did you kinda neglect this year? (e.g. my mom)
-  What are you most ashamed of from this year?
-  What made you cry this year?
-  What are some events from the year that you might need to process in the future? List them down.

## 3 Release

Identify emotionally juicy experiences, events and patterns from the year. Practice letting go of them.

-  Write down everything you want to let go of on a piece of paper and light it on fire, ceremonially.
-  Write down what you’re most ashamed of from the year on a piece of paper and light it on fire, ceremonially.
-  Text a loving message to 3 people who A) are important to you and B) you feel any desire to make amends to.
-  Send a gratitude text to 3 people who you have quiet, under-expressed appreciation for. Let them know they matter to you.
-  Listen to a sad song while reviewing the things that made you cry this year.

Pause. Take a break. Do something completely different for at least 30mins or at most a whole day. Come back to Step 4 with a fresh mind.

## 4 Resolve

Based on your insights and reflections, articulate meaningful intentions for your future.

-  What advice would you give yourself for the next year?
-  What’s one habit of yours you would instantly “delete” if you could?
-  Make a [[Yearly goal template|commitment]] based on the insights above.
-  What Projects would you like to start? List their ideal outcomes and next actions.
-  What habits would you like to install in the coming year?
-  What word would you like to guide you throughout the coming year? Tweet it.
-  What affirmations would you like to keep in mind throughout the coming year?
-  It’s rare that you will make major progress in several categories at the same time. Major progress in any category requires significant attention. What are 1-3 areas of your life that you want to focus most on in 2022?
-  Who would you like to keep you accountable in 2022? Text them with a request.
-  What do you want to happen next year in each of [[My life areas 2023]] of your life?
