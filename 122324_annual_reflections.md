# Annual Reflection 2024

Below is a two-part (“Science” → “Poetry”) framework for your annual review. It integrates:
• Month-over-month metrics, Business reflection, ICP/sales pipeline checkpoints, personal introspection, Excalidraw references, and “Month of the Year retrospective template.md.”  
• Bullet Journal–style data tracking, gratitude/regret prompts, and a Hero’s Journey narrative for your moonshot goals.

---
## Part I: Science (Rational)

### 1. Month-Over-Month Metrics Review
Use your monthly data (see “Month of the year retrospective template.md”):
1. Monthly revenue and DAU (with % changes MoM).  
2. Hours spent on communication skills, HRV, strain, etc.  
3. Education metrics: books read, hours spent writing/course-based activities.  
4. Compare actual values vs. prior targets/goals.  
5. Final Notes: Where did you excel, and where did you lag?

> Prompt: “What key takeaways emerge from the metrics? Which monthly changes stand out?”

#### Incorporate Bullet Journal + Data-Driven Approach
• Write quick bullet points of any major wins/losses that month (new hires, product releases).  
• Track key metrics vs. your monthly or quarterly goals for easy visual comparison.  
• List top experiments (A/B tests, new channels) and their outcomes.

---

### 2. Startup Reflection

1. **Company Progress & Idea**  
   - In one sentence: what problem are you solving?  
   - How many users/customers/revenue MoM?  
   - Competitors: what’s your unique insight vs. theirs?  

2. **Funding & Equity**  
   - List any investors or accelerators.  
   - Potential runway issues?  

3. **Future Roadmap**  
   - Next steps for product or technology.  
   - Regulatory or compliance steps (if relevant).  

4. **Personal Fit & Why You?**  
   - Domain expertise, motivation, personal story that drives you.  

> Prompt: “Which questions bring up new insights about your strategy, or highlight areas that need more attention?”

---

### 3. ICP & Sales Pipeline
Review your target audience:
• Do the ICPs (ideal customer profiles) still hold?  
• Have new angles emerged?  
• Where are you in your sales pipeline? (Leads → Prospects → Negotiations → Closed deals)  
• Any CRM updates or next steps for each lead?

> Prompt: “How has your ideal buyer changed? Which sales tactics worked best?”

---

### 4. Planning for Next Year
1. **Quarterly Milestones**  
   - Q1: …  
   - Q2: …  
   - Q3: …  
   - Q4: …  
2. **Monthly Checkpoints**  
   - Align each month with your bigger quarterly goals.  
3. **Experiments**  
   - Which growth experiments, product features, or new channels will you test?

> Prompt: “What’s your high-level timeline, and how do you measure success each quarter/month?”

---

### 5. Gratitude & Regret Check (Science Perspective)
1. **Gratitude**  
   - Who or what resources were significant to your success?  
   - Any mentors, customers, or breakthroughs that deserve a shout-out?  
2. **Regrets or Missed Opportunities**  
   - Pinpoint bad hires, missteps, or wasted efforts.  
   - How can you avoid repeating them?

> Prompt: “Which regrets hold lessons that guide my next strategic moves?”

---

## Part II: Poetry (Emotional & Personal)

### 6. Inner Scorecard & Values
• Review your personal mission, inner scorecard, and core values (see Excalidraw for reference if you store them visually).  
• Ask yourself: “Did I stay true to my values? Where did I compromise them? Did my sense of purpose evolve?”

> Prompt: “Reflect on a moment (in life or business) that tested your values. What did you learn?”

---

### 7. Relationship CRM & Timeline Check
• **Relationship CRM**: Open your Excalidraw file to see your key personal and professional relationships.  
   - Who supported you the most this year?  
   - Where do you need to invest more time or emotional energy?  
• **Life Timeline**: Review your life-milestones Excalidraw for perspective.  
   - Notable life events or turning points this year?  
   - Are you still on the bigger narrative you envisioned?

> Prompt: “When I look at my relationship map, I realize…”

---

### 8. Emotional Check-In
1. **Feelings & Highlights** – Write freely about the peaks and valleys of the year.  
2. **Moments of Joy** – Celebrate breakthroughs or times you felt truly alive.  
3. **Moments of Challenge** – Name disappointments, regrets, or emotional blocks.  
4. **Legacy of the Year** – If this year had a voice, what story would it tell?

> Prompt: “When I look back on this year, I want to remember…”

---

### 9. Education & Personal Growth
1. **Books Completed** – Summarize each major lesson or note.  
2. **Courses, Writing Practice** – Did you improve your craft or discover new interests?  
3. **Application** – Have these learnings visibly changed your startup or personal relationships?

> Prompt: “Which resources impacted me the most, and how can I continue to apply those lessons?”

---

### 10. Hero’s Journey + Moonshot
Inspired by the classic storytelling framework:

1. **Call to Adventure**  
   - What sparked your key goals this year?  
   - State your 5–10 year moonshot vision.  
2. **Trials & Allies**  
   - Biggest challenges, resource constraints, or failures.  
   - Key supporters or tools that helped.  
3. **Transformation & Lessons**  
   - Mindset shifts, process improvements, or pivot decisions.  
   - Summarize key insights to drive next steps.  
4. **Return with Elixir**  
   - How do these lessons shape your next roadmap?  
   - Outline concrete projects that support your moonshot.  
   - List required resources, metrics to track, deadlines.

> Prompt: “If I am the protagonist of my own story, how did this year’s trials elevate me toward my bigger destiny?”

---

## Bringing It All Together

1. **Synthesis**  
   - Highlight 3–5 overarching lessons from Part I (metrics, strategy) and Part II (values, feelings).  
2. **Action Items**  
   - Based on your reflections, list key next steps (both rational checkpoints and emotional wellness items).  
3. **Review Frequency**  
   - Plan quarterly or monthly check-ins to keep your insights alive.

> Final Prompt: “Now that I’ve seen the big picture, how do I integrate these lessons into my next steps?”

---

### Extra Reminders & Tools
1. Use “Month of the year retrospective template.md” for monthly memory prompts.  
2. Update your Excalidraw timeline & CRM (relationship map + life milestones).  
3. Revise your personal “inner scorecard” if it evolved.  
4. Keep referencing the business questions to remain clear on your startup’s fundamentals.  
5. If any regrets formed in Part I, transform them into new action items or experiments.

This template weaves hard data (Part I) with deeper emotional narrative (Part II). Combining bullet journal–style metrics, gratitude/regret reflection, and the Hero’s Journey ensures you capture both the tangible results and the intangible growth—all geared toward your moonshot vision. Good luck!
