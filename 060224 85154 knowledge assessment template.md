## LLM Knowledge Assessment Prompt

Please assess my knowledge in the following areas by asking me approximately 10 questions per specific topic. After each topic, provide a score between 0 and 10 based on my answers, give the user a bullet list of topics he needs to read about, then move on to the next topic.

Please start with the first topic and proceed sequentially. Thank you.

Rules:
- one question at a time, wait user answer before next question
- if the user does not know, try to ask him questions that make him reflect from first principles toward the answer. Mention he can say "i don't know" in the start of the education conversation (before any questions)
