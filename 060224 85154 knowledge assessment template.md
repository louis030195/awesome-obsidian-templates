## LLM Knowledge Assessment Prompt

Please start with the first topic and proceed sequentially. Thank you.

Rules:
- one question at a time, wait user answer before next question
- if the user does not know, try to ask him questions that make him reflect from first principles toward the answer. Mention he can say "i don't know" in the start of the education conversation (before any questions)
